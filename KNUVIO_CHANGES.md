# knuvio changes

Everything knuvio adds on top of [NuvioMedia/NuvioTV](https://github.com/NuvioMedia/NuvioTV). Each entry says why the change
exists, which files it touches, and how to remove it. Read this first when an upstream merge conflicts.

Files under `app/src/full/res`, `app/src/fullDebug/res`, `knuvio-branding/` and the knuvio workflow are knuvio-only and cannot
conflict. **Upstream files that knuvio edits** are the ones to watch:

| Upstream file | Changed by |
|---|---|
| `app/build.gradle.kts` | [K-02](#k-02-application-ids-and-updater-source) |
| `app/src/main/java/com/nuvio/tv/updater/VersionUtils.kt` | [K-05](#k-05-knuvio-revisions-in-the-updater) |

Upstream status: **knuvio only** = not meant for upstream; **upstream PR #N** = proposed; **in upstream since X** = the change
can be dropped from knuvio after merging X.

## K-01 Branding: icons, banner, app name, wordmarks

- **Why:** knuvio must be recognisable next to the official app on the same TV.
- **What:**
  - K launcher icon (all densities), splash mark (`app_logo_mark`), TV banner.
  - App name "knuvio" in every locale; debug builds show "knuvio Debug".
  - In-app wordmark (`app_logo_wordmark` plus the five themed variants) with the K mark.
  - The five alternative launcher icons and banners (arctic blue, emerald, rose gold, copper, graphite), recoloured K.
- **Files:** `app/src/full/res/**` (`mipmap-*`, `drawable/`, `values*/strings_knuvio.xml`),
  `app/src/fullDebug/res/values/strings_knuvio.xml`, `knuvio-branding/**` (source artwork and generator scripts).
- **Commits:** `a8d06b712`, `dce6f721c`, `f7e032b73`, `17e90709f`.
- **Remove:** delete the files; the upstream resources in `app/src/main/res` take over.
- **Upstream status:** knuvio only.
- **Watch:** a new upstream locale with `app_name` needs its own `strings_knuvio.xml`; a new theme or icon option needs a
  regenerated variant (see `knuvio-branding/`).

## K-02 Application IDs and updater source

- **Why:** knuvio installs next to the official app, is signed with its own key, and must update from knuvio releases.
- **What:** `com.knuvio.tv` (full), `com.knuvio.app` (playstore), debug `com.knuviodebug.com` / `com.knuvio.appdebug`;
  `GITHUB_OWNER`/`GITHUB_REPO` = `kernexshadow`/`knuvio`.
- **Files:** `app/build.gradle.kts` (5 lines: two `applicationId`, the debug `variant.applicationId`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`).
- **Commits:** `b3a8f4708`.
- **Remove:** revert the commit. Installed knuvio apps would then be replaced by, or conflict with, the official app.
- **Upstream status:** knuvio only. A configurable owner/repo (Gradle property with NuvioMedia as default) could be proposed
  upstream to shrink this diff.

## K-03 Upstream sync and release workflow

- **Why:** follow upstream releases without manual work, and publish signed APKs.
- **What:** `.github/workflows/knuvio-sync-release.yml`: scheduled merge of upstream release tags, manual `+k.N` revision builds,
  versionName stamping, disabling inherited workflows, signed release build and GitHub release. Details in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
- **Files:** `.github/workflows/knuvio-sync-release.yml`.
- **Commits:** `08f38f567`, `2ce5024ec`, `d89acd56a`, `720c09f89`.
- **Remove:** delete the workflow; releases then have to be built by hand.
- **Upstream status:** knuvio only.

## K-04 Project notes

- **Why:** keep how knuvio works, and why each change exists, next to the code.
- **Files:** `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (force-added: upstream's `.gitignore` ignores `CLAUDE.md`), `KNUVIO_CHANGES.md`.
- **Upstream status:** knuvio only.

## K-05 knuvio revisions in the updater

- **Why:** manual knuvio builds of the same upstream version (`+k.1`, `+k.2`, …) must be offered as updates, for betas and
  stable versions alike, while any newer upstream version still wins.
- **What:** `SemanticVersion` gets `knuvioRevision`, parsed from `+k` / `+k.N` build metadata and compared only when everything
  else is equal. Other build metadata stays ignored, so upstream's tests still pass.
- **Files:** `app/src/main/java/com/nuvio/tv/updater/VersionUtils.kt` (upstream file),
  `app/src/test/java/com/nuvio/tv/updater/KnuvioRevisionTest.kt` (knuvio-only tests).
- **Commits:** `42314d583`.
- **Remove:** revert the commit and stop publishing `+k.N` builds (the workflow's manual mode depends on it).
- **Upstream status:** knuvio only.
- **Watch:** upstream edits to `VersionUtils.kt` will conflict. Keep the `knuvioRevision` comparison as the last tie-breaker
  and run `:app:testFullDebugUnitTest --tests 'com.nuvio.tv.updater.*'`.
